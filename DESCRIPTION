Title: In-Silico Annotation of Doublets for Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data
Version: 0.99.1
Author: Dennis Kostka
Maintainer: Dennis Kostka <kostka@pitt.edu>
Description: In single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data combinations of cells are sometimes considered a single cell (doublets). The scds package provides methods to annotate doublets in scRNA-seq data computationally.
